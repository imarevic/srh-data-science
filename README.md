# Project SRH - Proof of concept

https://ixians.atlassian.net/browse/SRH-1

For a first iteration we need a PoC that consists of a nice and informative chapter that we can showcase with JupyterBook, interactive computing and deployment.

Deadline: March 1st


To set up the conda environment run `conda env create -f environment.yml`. This will create an environment `srh-poc`, run `conda activate srh-poc` and you are ready to go.

*Make sure that you are in the folder that conrtains the `environment.yml` file, otherwise use the right file path*
